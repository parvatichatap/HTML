    <p class="p1">Happy Ram Navami 2023 Wishes Images, Messages, Photos, and Status: Ram Navmi is celebrated on the ninth day of the Shukla Paksha
         of Chaitra month each year. It marks the birthday of Lord Rama, who is considered to be the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu
          in Hindu mythology. According to legends, Lord Rama was born on the ninth day of Chaitra Navratri to King Dasharatha and
           Queen Kausalya in Ayodhya, in present-day Uttar Pradesh in India.
        On this day, people listen to recitals of the Ram katha, or stories from Lord Rama’s childhood, including texts from 
        the sacred epic of Ramayana. It is also a day of introspection and self-reflection and symbolizes the victory of good
         over evil, and the establishment of the ‘dharma’ over ‘adharma’.
        
        This year, Ram Navmi falls on March 30, 2023. Below are wishes, images, messages, photos and status for Whatsapp and
         Facebook to share with family and friends.</p>
