            <h2> Difference between collection, Collection and Collections in java?</h2>
            <h1>collection : represent group of objects where objects are stored.
                Collection : This is one of the core interface which provides basic functionality for collection.
            </h1>

                <p> Explain what is encapsulation?
                    Encapsulation is the process of wrapping of code and behaviour in a single unit called class and
                    preventing
                    from misuse is called encapsulation. Encapsulation exposes only part of object which are safe to
                    exposed
                    and remaining part of object is kept secured.
                    Encapsulation is supported through access control in java. There are four types of access control
                    specifiers(public,private, protected, default) in java which supports encapsulation.
                    For example tv manufacturers exposes only buttons not all the thousands of electronic components
                    which
                    it is made up of.
                    195) What is inheritance ?
                    Inheritance is one of the important feature of object oriented language. Inheriting is the process
                    of
                    acquiring features of others. For example a child acquires the features of their parents.
                    In java inheritance is the process of inheriting member of existing classes by extending their
                    functionality.
                    The original class is called base class, parent class or super class. The new class derived from
                    parent is
                    <img src="./images/nature.jfif" alt="" width="300">
                    called child class, sub class, and derived class.
                    We use extends keyword in java to extend a class in java. All java classes extend java.lang.Object
                    since
                    object class is the super class for all classes in java.
                    When we create a new class by using inheritance ‘is-a’ relationship is formed.
                    196) Explain importance of inheritance in java?
                    Reusability :The major advantage of inheritance is code reuse. We can avoid duplicating code by
                    using
                    inheritance. We can place all common state and behaviour in that class , by extending that class we
                    can
                    Extendability : We can add new functionality to our application without touching the existing code.
                    For example if we take Ms word we came across number of versions of msword such as word 2003,2007.
                    Everytime they won’t write new code they reuse the existing code and some more features.
                    197) What is polymorphism in java?
                    Polymorphism is combination of two greek words which mean many forms. In polymorphism actual type
                    of object involved in method call determines which method to call rather type of reference variable.
                    59) What is covariant return ?
                    <img src="./images/download (1).jfif" alt="">
                    In java 1.4 and earlier one method can override super class method if both methods have same
                    signature
                    and return types.
                    From Java 1.5 , a method can override other method if argument types match exactly though return
                    types are different.(Return type must be subtype of other method).
                    Example : Class A</p>
